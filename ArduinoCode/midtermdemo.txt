Midterm Demo:

Key Engineering Specs:
	- Speed of Facial Recoginition:
		to have a positive ID or false provided within 10 secs
	- Speed of Fingerprint Scanner
		to have a positive ID or fasle provided within 10 secs
	- Mobile Application for User (Possibly need to change)
		provide the user with an easy to use mobile application.

1. Initialization
	* Talk about Mobile App Engineering Spec here, maybe elaborate on complete plan for app*
	- Logging into the app						<Eric>
	- Creating a new lock in the database with mac address		<Eric>
	- Connecting the Wi-Fi module to Wi-Fi 				<Eric>

2. Minor Setups from app
	- Enrolling a fingerprint					<Matthew>
	- Adding picture to database					<Matthew>
	- Enrolling RFID						<Matthew>

3. Facial Recognition
	* Lets use a timer to show how long it takes to have a new face compared against the database *
	- Have the ESP tell screen to "Come in view"			<Gabe>
	- Get the ID back and show that face rec was successful		<Gabe>

4. RFID
	- Have the screen ask for RFID					<KV>
	- Show a successful message					<KV>

5. Fingerprint
	- Have user input fingerprint					<KV>
	- Show the ID being found					<KV>
	- Then show id returned from sending finger ID to Database	<KV>

6. Opening the lock
	- Show the tructure for keeping track of security checks	<KV>
	- Show the lock opening						<KV>
